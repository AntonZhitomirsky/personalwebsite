# Personal Website

Implementation for the personal website used to showcase some projects, but most of all to present myself and my curiosities to all those that visit it.

My plans at the moment are to implement a reactive site using html and javascript modules to get the most reactive and pleasant experience possible as offered by the current formatting and reactive tools available.
